# Synthetic Medical Image Generation using GANs

Medical image datasets are often constrained by privacy concerns and scarcity of labeled data. Deep learning models demand extensive, diverse datasets for effective training. To address this, we propose leveraging Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for synthetic medical image generation. By augmenting existing datasets with synthetic images, we aim to enhance deep learning model performance in medical image analysis tasks. This project seeks to explore the potential of GANs in addressing the data scarcity challenge in healthcare AI.

## Problem Statement

The scarcity of labeled medical image datasets due to privacy concerns and data limitations impedes the training of deep learning models. Augmenting datasets with synthetic images is crucial for overcoming these constraints and improving model performance.

## Dataset

We'll be using the Chest X-ray (pneumonia) dataset described and analyzed in "Deep learning-based classification and referral of treatable human diseases". The dataset consists of validated OCT and Chest X-Ray images split into a training set and a testing set of independent patients. OCT Images are labeled as (disease)-(randomized patient ID)-(image number by this patient) and split into 4 directories: CNV, DME, DRUSEN, and NORMAL.
